# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
I was pretty excited about getting the algorithm working, and as far as learning as much of  the syntax as I have. 


1. What do you need to improve?
Understanding how to call methods outside of classes, how to create tests for specific tasks. I feel I did massive damage to the program, trying to get a test to pass that I didn't understand. 

1. What questions do you still have?
How to get methods communicating between themselves between classes.

# Rubric

## Functionality - 2

Notes:

- [ ] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 2

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ ] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [ ] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design 2

Notes:

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 2 

Notes: I don't understand testing well enough at all, I spent last night and this morning breaking my code trying to get a test to pass I didn't understand. 

The student(s):

- [ ] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [ ] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [ ] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control. 3

Notes: All I uploaded was my original algorithm without methods, I feel I understand github well enough I could have uploaded everything without too many hiccups. 

The student(s):

- [ x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [ ] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
